"Like most good ideas, it began with a frustration over the status quo. Networks were too complex, too costly and too inefficient.Dave’s eureka moment came when reading Microsoft’s paper on traffic patterns, understanding that network congestion was a result of inefficient conversations taking place within its infrastructure. So, he created an SDN controller to understand and direct these conversations. However, Dave soon realized that the dynamic software could only work with underlying hardware that would also change on the fly. Thus, the Plexxi Switch was born, using photonic switching technologies to bring an adaptable capacity to a previously static environment.",,Plexxi,,,Rethinking the network.,,,"$8,300,000","Feb 15, 2011","$20,000,000","Jul 28, 2011","$20,100,000","Jun 29, 2012",,,
